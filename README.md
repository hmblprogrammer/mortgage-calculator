# Dynamic Mortgage Modeler

## Overview

This Mortgage Calculator is a simple, easy-to-use web-based tool designed for
calculating mortgages with the ability to incorporate multiple recast payments.
This feature allows users to see the impact of additional principal payments on
their mortgage schedule, which is crucial for planning early payoffs and
managing monthly budgets effectively.

## Motivation

When searching for mortgage tools, I found none that offered the functionality
to calculate the effects of recasting a mortgage. This functionality is useful
for anyone looking to optimize their mortgage payments and better manage their
financial planning. Additionally, I wanted something that runs locally on the
user's machine, ensuring privacy and control by not sending personal
information to servers, avoiding unnecessary tracking and ad targeting.

## Features

- Calculate monthly mortgage payments.
- Generate a detailed amortization schedule.
- Allow for multiple recast scenarios to adjust the principal and observe the
  resulting changes in monthly payments and overall loan term.
- Runs entirely locally, with no data sent externally and no tracking or ads.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Status

This is a personal project and a fun way to experiment with generative AI. It is
currently in a functional state and open for contributions and enhancements
from the developer community.

## Disclaimer

Because it has to be said:

This tool is provided as-is without any warranty. While it aims to be accurate,
it may contain errors or inaccuracies. Users should verify the calculations
independently and consult with a financial advisor or mortgage professional
before making financial decisions based on this tool.

I'm not a financial advisor nor an expert in mortgage amortization calculations.
I've checked this tool against some of the online tools I was using before this
existed and it matched in my tests, but the testing was far from comprehensive!
